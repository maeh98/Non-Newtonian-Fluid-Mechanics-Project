# Non Newtonian Fluid Mechanics Project. June 2018 
In this group project we modelled the Dynamics of Newtonian and Viscoelastic Fluids across several problems. We also performed a numerical investigation. 

Project Title: Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics. \

Abstract:
Non-Newtonian fluids are hugely important in our lives; from the blood in our veins to the ketchup in
our kitchen cupboards, we come into contact with them every day. They are essential in a wide range of
subjects, such as chemical engineering and pharmaceutics, so it is useful to develop and understand the
mathematics behind these fluids. In this project, we aim to compare properties of Newtonian and non-
Newtonian fluids both analytically and numerically. Starting with Newtonian fluids, we explore problems
such as the Couette Plane Problem and the Stokes Second Problem. We introduce the idea of modelling
non-Newtonian fluids, in particular we explore the Oldroyd-B model in order to differentiate between
viscoelastic fluids and Newtonian fluids in similar problems. We go on to numerically investigate solutions
for non-Newtonian fluids based on more complex models, such as the power-law and Carreau-Yasuda
models.
